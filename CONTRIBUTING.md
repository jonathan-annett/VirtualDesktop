# Contributing

This project is a fork of [an open source project](https://github.com/MScholtes/VirtualDesktop), with specific customizations to make it suitable for use with desktop applications that wish to use the utility via a stdio pipe.

It is suggested you [contribute to the parent repository directly](https://github.com/MScholtes/VirtualDesktop/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), as this will benefit the original author, and thus the entire open source community that relies on his work. Any useful substantial contributions to his work will be added to this project in due course.

This fork was made specifically for use with [virtual-desktop-node](https://github.com/jonathan-annett/virtual-desktop-node) which is in turn used by [sophtwhere-virtual-desktop](https://github.com/jonathan-annett/companion-module-sophtwhere-virtual-desktop) ( a bitfocus companion module, for allowing desktop switching with elgato streamdeck under companion)
